# FAQ

### How can I check if my ETH address is certified?
You can check the status of your certification [here](/#/check).

### What do I have to consider when going through the KYC process?
Make sure you submit your surname (last name) and given names (including middle name) in the correct order. Also when you upload a valid file type such as a jpg, png or pdf, the file size must be between 32KB and 10MB.

**Other requirements:**

+ Your pictures are as clear and as evenly lit as possible. Be careful with shadows (including your own) and use a desk lamp if you need some extra lighting
+ The whole document is placed on a flat surface with a plain background
+ The photo is taken from above looking straight down at the document and not at an angle
+ There is nothing obstructing the picture
+ The whole document is visible – try not to cut off the corners or edges of the documents
+ Make sure the picture is in color, not black and white

Make sure you are using one of the [Supported Documents](https://info.onfido.com/supported-documents).

### Can I certify more than one ETH address?
No, each individual can only certify one ETH address. Every attempt to register a second ETH address will fail.

### Can I get a refund for the fee I paid?
If you have paid the fee and have not initiated the KYC process you may be eligible for a refund. Please
visit [this page](/#/refund) or email us at [picops@parity.io](mailto:picops@parity.io).

If you have paid the fee and have initiated the KYC process unfortunately, we are not able to refund your fee. Our KYC service is provided by a third party. You can check out our [terms and conditions](/#/tc).

### Can the PICOPS team manually certify me?
Unfortunately the KYC service is provided by a 3rd party, and we have no influence over their process. Therefore we can not manually certify you.

### Can I certify my business?
PICOPS intends to link identities of individuals to their Ethereum addresses. Therefore only natural persons can certify.

### Can I change the ETH address associated with my ID?
Under specific circumstances we are able to change the ETH address you certified. This includes the accidental linking of your ID to an exchange or a hardware wallet address. Please contact [picops@parity.io](mailto:picops@parity.io) for further information.

### Can I use PICOPS for my own project?
We are interested in working with other teams. At the moment we are rather busy with the PICOPS launch, but if you write us an email at [picops@parity.io](mailto:picops@parity.io), we’ll come back to you. You can find more information regarding PICOPS in our [blog post](https://paritytech.io/blog/parity-technologies-launches-picops.html).
